# Feel-flux
This project is basically a sentiment analysis which will work in input and output format. The user will give an input in the form of a textual content and the the code will process every bit of it and generate the output accordingly. Output of the code will vary between 3 parameters that are positive, negative and neutral. 
The output of the code solely depends on user's input. Let me address the elephant in the room, yes i know this is a very common project but i chose this project as my first ever project in college. 
This project can be used to check sentiment of a tweet from X, it can be used to check emotion of a particular lyric snippet, paragraphs, single word and any other possible form of textual content. 
Feel free to contribute and if you come up with any error or uncertainity in the code or in the output then you can raise an issue in the repository i'll try to resolve it and get back to you.
